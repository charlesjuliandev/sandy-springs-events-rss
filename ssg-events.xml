‚òÄÔ∏èSummer Concerts in Sandy Springs

 

Tonic 



Music always undoubtedly brings us closer together. The connection forged runs as deep as any family bond does. Similarly, the story of Tonic revolves around the longstanding, close brotherhood shared among members Emerson Hart [vocals, guitar], Jeff Russo [lead guitar], and Dan Lavery [bass]. Since 1996, the GRAMMY¬ÆÔ∏è Award-nominated multi-platinum trio has consistently delivered anthemic and undeniable rock fashioned from eloquent songcraft, lyrical honesty, and unshakable melodies. Along the way, they translated true experiences and real memories into a storied catalog that resounds as loudly today as it did over two decades ago.

‚ÄúSometimes, I‚Äôll see somebody in the crowd who‚Äôs not more than twenty-years-old,‚Äù says Emerson. ‚ÄúThis person will be singing a thought I had in 1995 right back to me: every word and every note. Realizing the power of that was a big moment for me. If there are people in the crowd and we‚Äôre playing together, that‚Äôs the magic of it. We still love it. There‚Äôs an understanding this is bigger than us.‚Äù

The songs continue to endure. To date, the band has landed six Top 10 singles, sold 4 million-plus records, and garnered a pair of GRAMMY¬ÆÔ∏è Award nominations. As the story goes, Emerson and Jeff linked up together in Los Angeles as Tonic during 1994, with Dan joining the group in 1996. Inspired after catching U2‚Äôs Joshua Tree Tour in his native New Jersey, Emerson went to L.A., where he and Jeff launched the group. Their full-length debut, Lemon Parade, not only went platinum, but it also yielded the ‚Äú#1 Most-Played Rock Song of 1997‚Äù in the form of the lead single ‚ÄúIf You Could Only See.‚Äù The band‚Äôs follow-up single, ‚ÄúYou Wanted More,‚Äù served as the lead-off from the platinum Original Soundtrack Album for American Pie and the second full-length, Sugar.

In between a marathon of touring, they released Head On Straight in 2002. The single ‚ÄúTake Me As I Am‚Äù received a GRAMMY¬ÆÔ∏è Award nomination in the category of ‚ÄúBest Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal‚Äù as the album vied for ‚ÄúBest Rock Album‚Äù‚Äîonly to lose to Bruce Springsteen, ‚Äúwhich is still a huge honor being from Jersey,‚Äù laughs Dan.

After a five-year hiatus, the three-piece returned to the charts on the heels of Tonic in 2010, landing in the Top 50 of the Billboard Top Rock Albums Chart and Top 25 of the Billboard Top Independent Albums Chart. Following a successful Pledge Music campaign, they re-recorded the seminal Lemon Parade acoustically for 2016‚Äôs Lemon Parade Revisited.

‚ÄúThe idea was, ‚ÄòHow do we do something new?‚Äô,‚Äù continues Jeff. ‚ÄúWe wanted to take it back to the origins of the tracks. So, we sat in a room with acoustic guitars and played. It was a gratifying moment. At the same time, it made us realize that we really enjoy making rock. We love the thrill of playing. It‚Äôs come full circle recently, and it‚Äôs affected what we‚Äôre creating now.‚Äù

Outside of Tonic, each musician made a pronounced musical impact of his own. As a sought-after composer for film, television, and video games, Jeff wrote the score for HBO‚Äôs critically acclaimed The Night Of in addition to composing for Legion, Counterpart, Star Trek: Discovery, and more. He garnered the 2017 Primetime Emmy¬ÆÔ∏è Award in the category of ‚ÄúOutstanding Music Composition for a Limited Series, Movie, or Special‚Äù for Fargo. Dan played bass in the multiplatinum pop rock outfit The Fray before going on to establish himself as a writer and producer. In recent years, he‚Äôs been involved in artist management, working with the likes of Joe Jonas and Adam Lambert. Meanwhile, Emerson ignited a successful solo career, including albums such as Cigarettes and Gasoline [2007], Beauty in Disrepair [2014], and his 2019 third full-length 32 Thousand Days.

No matter what, the members of Tonic find themselves coming back together, hitting the road every year.

‚ÄúThis is like musical home base for us,‚Äù Dan leaves off. ‚ÄúFrom there, we can branch out and do other things, but this is something we all go back to. The fact the three of us have managed to stay together since 1996 with only a few years off is something we‚Äôre very proud of. The truth is we‚Äôre just three dudes from New Jersey and New York who have the same sensibilities. That‚Äôs why we‚Äôre still together decades later.‚Äù

Jeff agrees, ‚ÄúEvery time we get back together, it just sounds and feels like Tonic.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe songs keep us around,‚Äù smiles Emerson. ‚ÄúWe love seeing the excitement in fans‚Äô eyes. We‚Äôre all connected. When we play, it‚Äôs a moment where we all feel something together.‚Äù | Venue: City Green</description><pubDate>Sat, 12 Apr 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://up.sandyspringsga.ddev.site/sites/default/files/2025-02/Tonic%20-%202025%20Approved%20Photo%20%28Resized%29.jpg" type="image/jpeg" length="0"/></item><item><title>Sandy Springs Farmers Market 2025</title><link>https://sandyspringsga.gov/events/sandy-springs-farmers-market-2025</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://sandyspringsga.gov/events/sandy-springs-farmers-market-2025</guid><description>Shop for fresh produce and artisan foods every Saturday morning at the Sandy Springs Farmers Market.

Your kids will dig for real fossils as we have over 70 different fossils to excavate. Each kid will take home three of their favorite fossils that they find. We also have an assortment of dinosaur statues in our "DINO PLAY YARD" ranging from several of our 2 foot baby dinos, to "Flower" our 8-foot long dino that all kids LOVE to play on and get their photos taken with. The best part is our meet and greet with our Lifesize prehistoric guest!

 Dino egg hunt, fossil dig, dino play yard and photo opportunities make this for a full-on Junior Paleontologist event. Registration required prior to event. Multiple egg hunt sessions available. Spots are limited in each session. We will not be able to accept registration on site.

Ansley Stewart Band



Forever the extrovert, Stewart is most comfortable on stage performing live. Her voice has been said to create life out of thin air (a phenomenon scientists have yet to explain). She emanates her own genre-blending sound that is undeniable upon first listen.

Her original music is written from a place of exploration, trust, and just having some damn fun. She has assembled some of Atlanta‚Äôs heavyweights (aka her best buds) to accompany her on the journey:

- Darren Stanley // Drums: Perpetual Groove, Ozone Squeeze, Jimmy Herring, Col. Bruce Hampton

- Nick Johnson // Guitar: Randall Bramblett

- Billy Thornton // Guitar: Ansley Stewart

- Robby Handley // Bass: Lera Lynn, ATL Collective Music Director

Stewart has become a fixture of the Atlanta music scene and has a reputation as one of the most versatile vocalists in town.
